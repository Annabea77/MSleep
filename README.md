# MSleep
msleep data set from R Studio

I used this data to refamiliarize myself to R Studio.  I had learned R during my Google Data Analytics course but since then I have been focusing on SQL. 
I found this data interesting so I did some exploring with R Studio. 

While running my queries I got a result that listed all my favorite animals.  I used that data for my bar graph.   Who knew all my favs were carnivores that sleep more than 8 hours a day?
